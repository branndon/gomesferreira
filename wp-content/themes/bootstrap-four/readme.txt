## Bootstrap Four

This is a starter WordPress theme for DEVELOPERS using Alpha Twitter Bootstrap 4

DevDmBootstrap3 was a great theme for WordPress developers. This theme aims to be the Bootstrap 4 counterpart to DevDM's excellent work.

This version conforms exactly to WordPress standards, you can find a slightly more opinionated version at http://github.com/hyprtxt/bootstrapfour
